# Backend Application

The backend application for this project is built using [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/), a Python framework for asynchronous web applications. The backend code is stored in the `app/backend` folder.

## Getting Started

To start the backend application, navigate to the `app` directory and run the `start.ps1` script:

```sh
cd app
./start.ps1
